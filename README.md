# estudio-2015
To prevent recoding, we should probably create a list of To-Do's and individually mark what they are doing.  We can populate this list as needed.  Hopefully this can keep us organized over the next month.  Please feel free to add to this list. 

##TO-DO:
####For Interface:
* 

####For Database:
* [Matt] Add a created date column when clients register an account
* Make prepared statements for all database writes

####For Reporting:
* [Matt] Adjust reporting queries for new EA database
* [Matt] Divide reportQueries file into different sections so it's not 1000 lines long
* [Matt] Refactor reporting methods to eliminate repetitive statements
* [Matt] Highlight % change in current reporting (red for - change, green for +)
