# estudio-2015

After you've gotten this branch into your local test server,
you'll want to head over to 
  'localhost/.../ea/backend'
where the ... is whatever directory you put the files in. Once you 
get there, you'll be presented with some nice installation 
screens. Unforunately, none of the info you add in will be 
stored until we get the database working correctly (nothing 
worked for me, so I assume that's the issue).
