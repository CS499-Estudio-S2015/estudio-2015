============
most of the restructing is done, but these forms have to connect to the
databases, so we need that pretty much asap. I'm looking through all of 
that now to see I can do any of it.

##to do
+  repurpose panel 3 on appointment wizard to account for missing data fields
  * ~~required visit~~
  * ~~why visiting? (oral presentation, digital media, writing help, etc)~~
  * ~~comment field~~ 'notes' already implemented
  * ~~move group size to this page?~~ this is fine where it is
+  clean up unused text from EA! (i.e, price, info on appointment confirmation)
+  ~~send user back to client page after an appointment has been made~~ added a button here
+  ~~remove current admin portal, move link to backend login~~
+  ~~change backend section to to be the new splash for admin portal~~
+
