# estudio-2015
To prevent recoding, we should probably create a list of To-Do's and individually mark what they are doing.  We can populate this list as needed.  Hopefully this can keep us organized over the next month.  Please feel free to add to this list. 

##DATABASE UPDATES:
* [4/12] ALTER TABLE ea_appointments ADD group_size int(4);

##TO-DO:
####For Interface & Database:
* ~~[Matt] Add Group Size to Appointment Registration form~~
* [] Add Required Visit to Appointment Registration form
* [] Add First Visit to Appointment Registration form
* [] Fix formatting issues caused by additional form inputs
* [] Integrate Client Login, Profile, etc into EA system
* [] Need to integrate major and year into the Client Registration
* [Matt] Add Link to Reporting Section of Admin Header
* [Matt] Add a created date column when clients register an account
* [] Add corresponding columns in database for added form inputs
* Make prepared statements for all database writes (May not need to do this anymore)

####For Reporting:
* [Matt] Adjust reporting queries for new EA database
