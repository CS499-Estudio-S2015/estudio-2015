##to do
+  repurpose panel 3 on appointment wizard to account for missing data fields
  * required visit
  * why visiting? (oral presentation, digital media, writing help, etc)
  * ~~move group size to this page?~~ this is fine where it is
+  clean up unused text from EA! (i.e, price, info on appointment confirmation)
+  ~~send user back to client page after an appointment has been made~~ added a button here
+  ~~remove current admin portal, move link to backend login~~
+  ~~change backend section to to be the new splash for admin portal~~
