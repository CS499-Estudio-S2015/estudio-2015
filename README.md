# estudio-2015
To prevent recoding, we should probably create a list of To-Do's and individually mark what they are doing.  We can populate this list as needed.  Hopefully this can keep us organized over the next month.  Please feel free to add to this list. 

#TO-DO:
[Matt] Add a created date column when clients register an account
Make prepared statements for all database writes
