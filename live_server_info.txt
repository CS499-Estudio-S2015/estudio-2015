eStudio Scheduling App - READ ME


Installation Guide
1. Where Do I put the webpages?
To simply put the webpages on the server of your choice. A UK server has been identified for hosting, however at the time of publication, the web application is currently unavailable.  A team member will work with UK IT over the summer to get this issue resolved. Login details are below: 
Server: scheduling.engr.uky.edu
Username: beta
Password: Riio$_284x
Login and put all of the php, css, html, and images contained on the CD on this, or another server of your choice. (For separate testing and modification, we recommend keeping a backup of the original working code for beta-testing on that server and using a multilab machine for the new testing. 


2. MySQL Database
To login to the MySQL database login to the server and start MySQL, using 
mysql –h localhost –u beta –p estudio_beta
database Name: estudio_beta
Input the password: MV.gVfRNzc
*Note all mysql commands must be terminated by a semicolon.*
